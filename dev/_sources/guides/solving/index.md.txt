# Solve Equations

The Python package SymPy can symbolically solve equations, differential
equations, linear equations, nonlinear equations, matrix problems, inequalities,
Diophantine equations, and evaluate integrals. SymPy can also solve numerically.

The [solving guide](solving-guidance.md) provides suggestions for many types of
solving tasks.

Note: SymPy has a function called {func}`~.solve` which is designed to find the
roots of an equation or system of equations. SymPy {func}`~.solve` may or may
not be what you need for a particular problem, so we recommend you use the links
on this page to learn how to "solve" your problem. And while a common,
colloquial expression is, for example, ["solve an
integral"](../../modules/integrals/integrals.rst), in SymPy's terminology it
would be ["evaluate an integral."](../../modules/integrals/integrals.rst)
