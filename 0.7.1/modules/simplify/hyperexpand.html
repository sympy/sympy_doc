<h2>Hypergeometric Function Expansion Algorithm<a class="headerlink" href="#hypergeometric-function-expansion-algorithm" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This section describes the algorithm used to expand hypergeometric functions.
Most of it is based on the papers <a class="reference internal" href="#roach1996">[Roach1996]</a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#roach1997">[Roach1997]</a>.</p>
<p>Recall that the hypergeometric function is (initially) defined as</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}{}_pF_q\left.\left(\begin{matrix} a_1, \dots, a_p \\ b_1, \dots, b_q \end{matrix}
                 \right| z \right)
    = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(a_1)_n \dots (a_p)_n}{(b_1)_n \dots (b_q)_n}
                        \frac{z^n}{n!}.\end{split}\]</div>
<p>It turns out that there are certain differential operators that can change the
<span class="math">\(a_p\)</span> and <span class="math">\(p_q\)</span> parameters by integers. If a sequence of such
operators is known that converts the set of indices <span class="math">\(a_r^0\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(b_s^0\)</span> into <span class="math">\(a_p\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b_q\)</span>, then we shall say the pair <span class="math">\(a_p,
b_q\)</span> is reachable from <span class="math">\(a_r^0, b_s^0\)</span>. Our general strategy is thus as
follows: given a set <span class="math">\(a_p, b_q\)</span> of parameters, try to look up an origin
<span class="math">\(a_r^0, b_s^0\)</span> for which we know an expression, and then apply the
sequence of differential operators to the known expression to find an
expression for the Hypergeometric function we are interested in.</p>
<div class="section" id="notation">
<h3>Notation<a class="headerlink" href="#notation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In the following, the symbol <span class="math">\(a\)</span> will always denote a numerator parameter
and the symbol <span class="math">\(b\)</span> will always denote a denominator parameter. The
subscripts <span class="math">\(p, q, r, s\)</span> denote vectors of that length, so e.g.
<span class="math">\(a_p\)</span> denotes a vector of <span class="math">\(p\)</span> numerator parameters. The subscripts
<span class="math">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math">\(j\)</span> denote &#8220;running indices&#8221;, so they should usually be used in
conjuction with a &#8220;for all <span class="math">\(i\)</span>&#8221;. E.g. <span class="math">\(a_i &lt; 4\)</span> for all <span class="math">\(i\)</span>.
Uppercase subscripts <span class="math">\(I\)</span> and <span class="math">\(J\)</span> denote a chosen, fixed index. So
for example <span class="math">\(a_I &gt; 0\)</span> is true if the inequality holds for the one index
<span class="math">\(I\)</span> we are currently interested in.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="incrementing-and-decrementing-indices">
<h3>Incrementing and decrementing indices<a class="headerlink" href="#incrementing-and-decrementing-indices" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Suppose <span class="math">\(a_i \ne 0\)</span>. Set <span class="math">\(A(a_i) =
\frac{z}{a_i}\frac{\mathrm{d}}{dz}+1\)</span>. It is then easy to show that
<span class="math">\(A(a_i) {}_p F_q\left.\left({a_p \atop b_q} \right| z \right) =
{}_p F_q\left.\left({a_p + e_i \atop b_q} \right| z \right)\)</span>,
where <span class="math">\(e_i\)</span> is the i-th unit vector.
Similarly for <span class="math">\(b_j \ne 1\)</span> we set <span class="math">\(B(b_j) = \frac{z}{b_j-1}
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{dz}+1\)</span> and find <span class="math">\(B(b_j) {}_p F_q\left.\left({a_p \atop b_q}
\right| z \right) = {}_p F_q\left.\left({a_p \atop b_q - e_i} \right| z \right)\)</span>.
Thus we can increment upper and decrement lower indices at will, as long as we
don&#8217;t go through zero. The <span class="math">\(A(a_i)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B(b_j)\)</span> are called shift
operators.</p>
<p>It is also easy to show that <span class="math">\(\frac{\mathrm{d}}{dz} {}_p F_q\left.\left({a_p
\atop b_q} \right| z \right) = \frac{a_1 \dots a_p}{b_1 \dots b_q} {}_p
F_q\left.\left({a_p + 1 \atop b_q + 1} \right| z \right)\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(a_p + 1\)</span> is
the vector <span class="math">\(a_1 + 1, a_2 + 1, \dots\)</span> and similarly for <span class="math">\(b_q + 1\)</span>.
Combining this with the shift operators,  we arrive at one form of the
Hypergeometric differential equation: <span class="math">\(\left[ \frac{\mathrm{d}}{dz}
\prod_{j=1}^q B(b_j) - \frac{a_1 \dots a_p}{(b_1-1) \dots (b_q-1)}
\prod_{i=1}^p A(a_i) \right] {}_p F_q\left.\left({a_p \atop b_q} \right| z \right) =
0\)</span>. This holds if all shift operators are defined, i.e. if no <span class="math">\(a_i = 0\)</span>
and no <span class="math">\(b_j = 1\)</span>. Clearing denominators and multiplying through by z we
arrive at the following equation: <span class="math">\(\left[ z\frac{\mathrm{d}}{dz}
\prod_{j=1}^q \left(z\frac{\mathrm{d}}{dz} + b_j-1 \right) - z \prod_{i=1}^p
\left( z\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}z} + a_i \right) \right] {}_p F_q\left.\left({a_p
\atop b_q} \right| z\right) = 0\)</span>. Even though our derivation does not show it,
it can be checked that this equation holds whenever the <span class="math">\({}_p F_q\)</span> is
defined.</p>
<p>Notice that, under suitable conditions on <span class="math">\(a_I, b_J\)</span>, each of the
operators <span class="math">\(A(a_i)\)</span>, <span class="math">\(B(b_j)\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(z\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}z}\)</span> can be expressed in terms of <span class="math">\(A(a_I)\)</span> or
<span class="math">\(B(b_J)\)</span>. Our next aim is to write the Hypergeometric differential
equation as follows: <span class="math">\([X A(a_I) - r] {}_p F_q\left.\left({a_p \atop b_q}
\right| z\right) = 0\)</span>, for some operator <span class="math">\(X\)</span> and some constant <span class="math">\(r\)</span>
to be determined. If
<span class="math">\(r \ne 0\)</span>, then we can write this as <span class="math">\(\frac{-1}{r} X {}_p F_q\left.\left({a_p +
e_I \atop b_q} \right| z\right) = {}_p F_q\left.\left({a_p \atop b_q} \right|
z\right)\)</span>, and so <span class="math">\(\frac{-1}{r}X\)</span> undoes the shifting of <span class="math">\(A(a_I)\)</span>,
whence it will be called an inverse-shift operator.</p>
<p>Now <span class="math">\(A(a_I)\)</span> exists if <span class="math">\(a_I \ne 0\)</span>, and then
<span class="math">\(z\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}z} = a_I A(a_I) - a_I\)</span>. Observe also that all the
operators <span class="math">\(A(a_i)\)</span>, <span class="math">\(B(b_j)\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(z\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}z}\)</span> commute. We have <span class="math">\(\prod_{i=1}^p \left(
z\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}z} + a_i \right) = \left(\prod_{i=1, i \ne I}^p
\left( z\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}z} + a_i \right)\right) a_I A(a_I)\)</span>, so
this gives us the first half of <span class="math">\(X\)</span>. The other half does not have such a
nice expression. We find <span class="math">\(z\frac{\mathrm{d}}{dz} \prod_{j=1}^q
\left(z\frac{\mathrm{d}}{dz} + b_j-1 \right) = \left(a_I A(a_I) - a_I\right)
\prod_{j=1}^q \left(a_I A(a_I) - a_I + b_j - 1\right)\)</span>. Since the first
half had no constant term, we infer <span class="math">\(r = -a_I\prod_{j=1}^q(b_j - 1
-a_I)\)</span>.</p>
<p>This tells us under which conditions we can &#8220;un-shift&#8221; <span class="math">\(A(a_I)\)</span>, namely
when <span class="math">\(a_I \ne 0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(r \ne 0\)</span>. Substituting <span class="math">\(a_I - 1\)</span> for
<span class="math">\(a_I\)</span> then tells us under what conditions we can decrement the index
<span class="math">\(a_I\)</span>. Doing a similar analysis for <span class="math">\(B(a_J)\)</span>, we arrive at the
following rules:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>An index <span class="math">\(a_I\)</span> can be decremented if <span class="math">\(a_I \ne 1\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(a_I \ne b_j\)</span> for all <span class="math">\(b_j\)</span>.</li>
<li>An index <span class="math">\(b_J\)</span> can be
incremented if <span class="math">\(b_J \ne -1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b_J \ne a_i\)</span> for all
<span class="math">\(a_i\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Combined with the conditions (stated above) for the existence of shift
operators, we have thus established the rules of the game!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reduction-of-order">
<h3>Reduction of Order<a class="headerlink" href="#reduction-of-order" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Notice that, quite trivially, if <span class="math">\(a_I = b_J\)</span>, we have <span class="math">\({}_p
F_q\left.\left({a_p \atop b_q} \right| z \right) = {}_{p-1} F_{q-1}\left.\left({a_p^*
\atop b_q^*} \right| z \right)\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(a_p^*\)</span> means <span class="math">\(a_p\)</span> with
<span class="math">\(a_I\)</span> omitted, and similarly for <span class="math">\(b_q^*\)</span>. We call this reduction of
order.</p>
<p>In fact, we can do even better. If <span class="math">\(a_I - b_J \in \mathbb{Z}_{&gt;0}\)</span>, then
it is easy to see that <span class="math">\(\frac{(a_I)_n}{(b_J)_n}\)</span> is actually a polynomial
in <span class="math">\(n\)</span>. It is also easy to see that
<span class="math">\((z\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}z})^k z^n = n^k z^n\)</span>. Combining these two remarks
we find:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>If <span class="math">\(a_I - b_J \in \mathbb{Z}_{&gt;0}\)</span>, then there exists a polynomial
<span class="math">\(p(n) = p_0 + p_1 n + \dots\)</span> (of degree <span class="math">\(a_I - b_J\)</span>) such
that <span class="math">\(\frac{(a_I)_n}{(b_J)_n} = p(n)\)</span> and <span class="math">\({}_p F_q\left.\left({a_p
\atop b_q} \right| z \right) = \left(p_0 + p_1
z\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}z} + p_2
\left.\left(z\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}z}\right)^2 + \dots \right) {}_{p-1}
F_{q-1}\left({a_p^* \atop b_q^*} \right| z \right)\)</span>.</div></blockquote>
<p>Thus any set of parameters <span class="math">\(a_p, b_q\)</span> is reachable from a set of
parameters <span class="math">\(c_r, d_s\)</span> where <span class="math">\(c_i - d_j \in \mathbb{Z}\)</span> implies
<span class="math">\(c_i &lt; d_j\)</span>. Such a set of parameters <span class="math">\(c_r, d_s\)</span> is called
suitable. Our database of known formulae should only contain suitable origins.
The reasons are twofold: firstly, working from suitable origins is easier, and
secondly, a formula for a non-suitable origin can be deduced from a lower order
formula, and we should put this one into the database instead.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="moving-around-in-the-parameter-space">
<h3>Moving Around in the Parameter Space<a class="headerlink" href="#moving-around-in-the-parameter-space" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It remains to investigate the following question: suppose <span class="math">\(a_p, b_q\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(a_p^0, b_q^0\)</span> are both suitable, and also <span class="math">\(a_i - a_i^0 \in
\mathbb{Z}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(b_j - b_j^0 \in \mathbb{Z}\)</span>. When is <span class="math">\(a_p, b_q\)</span>
reachable from <span class="math">\(a_p^0, b_q^0\)</span>? It is clear that we can treat all
parameters independently that are incongruent mod 1. So assume that <span class="math">\(a_i\)</span>
and <span class="math">\(b_j\)</span> are congruent to <span class="math">\(r\)</span> mod 1, for all <span class="math">\(i\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(j\)</span>. The same then follows for <span class="math">\(a_i^0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b_j^0\)</span>.</p>
<p>If <span class="math">\(r \ne 0\)</span>, then any such <span class="math">\(a_p, b_q\)</span> is reachable from any
<span class="math">\(a_p^0, b_q^0\)</span>. To see this notice that there exist constants <span class="math">\(c, c^0\)</span>,
congruent mod 1, such that <span class="math">\(a_i &lt; c &lt; b_j\)</span> for all <span class="math">\(i\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(j\)</span>, and similarly <span class="math">\(a_i^0 &lt; c^0 &lt; b_j^0\)</span>. If <span class="math">\(n = c - c^0 &gt; 0\)</span> then
we first inverse-shift all the <span class="math">\(b_j^0\)</span> <span class="math">\(n\)</span> times up, and then
similarly shift shift up all the <span class="math">\(a_i^0\)</span> <span class="math">\(n\)</span> times. If <span class="math">\(n &lt;
0\)</span> then we first inverse-shift down the <span class="math">\(a_i^0\)</span> and then shift down the
<span class="math">\(b_j^0\)</span>. This reduces to the case <span class="math">\(c = c^0\)</span>. But evidently we can
now shift or inverse-shift around the <span class="math">\(a_i^0\)</span> arbitrarily so long as we
keep them less than <span class="math">\(c\)</span>, and similarly for the <span class="math">\(b_j^0\)</span> so long as
we keep them bigger than <span class="math">\(c\)</span>. Thus <span class="math">\(a_p, b_q\)</span> is reachable from
<span class="math">\(a_p^0, b_q^0\)</span>.</p>
<p>If <span class="math">\(r = 0\)</span> then the problem is slightly more involved. WLOG no parameter
is zero. We now have one additional complication: no parameter can ever move
through zero. Hence <span class="math">\(a_p, b_q\)</span> is reachable from <span class="math">\(a_p^0, b_q^0\)</span> if
and only if the number of <span class="math">\(a_i &lt; 0\)</span> equals the number of <span class="math">\(a_i^0 &lt;
0\)</span>, and similarly for the <span class="math">\(b_i\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b_i^0\)</span>. But in a suitable set
of parameters, all <span class="math">\(b_j &gt; 0\)</span>! This is because the Hypergeometric function
is undefined if one of the <span class="math">\(b_j\)</span> is a non-positive integer and all
<span class="math">\(a_i\)</span> are smaller than the <span class="math">\(b_j\)</span>. Hence the number of <span class="math">\(b_j \le 0\)</span> is
always zero.</p>
<p>We can thus associate to every suitable set of parameters <span class="math">\(a_p, b_q\)</span>,
where no <span class="math">\(a_i = 0\)</span>, the following invariants:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>For every <span class="math">\(r \in [0, 1)\)</span> the number <span class="math">\(\alpha_r\)</span> of parameters
<span class="math">\(a_i \equiv r \pmod{1}\)</span>, and similarly the number <span class="math">\(\beta_r\)</span>
of parameters <span class="math">\(b_i \equiv r \pmod{1}\)</span>.</li>
<li>The number <span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span>
of integers <span class="math">\(a_i\)</span> with <span class="math">\(a_i &lt; 0\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The above reasoning shows that <span class="math">\(a_p, b_q\)</span> is reachable from <span class="math">\(a_p^0,
b_q^0\)</span> if and only if the invariants <span class="math">\(\alpha_r, \beta_r, \gamma\)</span> all
agree. Thus in particular &#8220;being reachable from&#8221; is a symmetric relation on
suitable parameters without zeros.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="applying-the-operators">
<h3>Applying the Operators<a class="headerlink" href="#applying-the-operators" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If all goes well then for a given set of parameters we find an origin in our
database for which we have a nice formula. We now have to apply (potentially)
many differential operators to it. If we do this blindly then the result will
be very messy. This is because with Hypergeometric type functions, the
derivative is usually expressed as a sum of two contiguous functions. Hence if
we compute <span class="math">\(N\)</span> derivatives, then the answer will involve <span class="math">\(2N\)</span>
contiguous functions! This is clearly undesirable. In fact we know from the
Hypergeometric differential equation that we need at most <span class="math">\(\max(p, q+1)\)</span>
contiguous functions to express all derivatives.</p>
<p>Hence instead of differentiating blindly, we will work with a
<span class="math">\(\mathbb{C}(z)\)</span>-module basis: for an origin <span class="math">\(a_r^0, b_s^0\)</span> we either store
(for particularly pretty answers) or compute a set of <span class="math">\(N\)</span> functions
(typically <span class="math">\(N = \max(r, s+1)\)</span>) with the property that the derivative of
any of them is a <span class="math">\(\mathbb{C}(z)\)</span>-linear combination of them. In formulae,
we store a vector <span class="math">\(B\)</span> of <span class="math">\(N\)</span> functions, a matrix <span class="math">\(M\)</span> and a
vector <span class="math">\(C\)</span> (the latter two with entries in <span class="math">\(\mathbb{C}(z)\)</span>), with
the following properties:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="math">\({}_r F_s\left.\left({a_r^0 \atop b_s^0} \right| z \right) = C B\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(z\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}z} B = M B\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then we can compute as many derivatives as we want and we will always end up
with <span class="math">\(\mathbb{C}(z)\)</span>-linear combination of at most <span class="math">\(N\)</span> special
functions.</p>
<p>As hinted above, <span class="math">\(B\)</span>, <span class="math">\(M\)</span> and <span class="math">\(C\)</span> can either all be stored
(for particularly pretty answers) or computed from a single <span class="math">\({}_p F_q\)</span>
formula.</p>

<h3>Loose Ends<a class="headerlink" href="#loose-ends" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

further tricks, described in the hyperexpand.py source file. The extension to
Meijer G-functions is also described there.</p>

<h2>Meijer G-Functions of Finite Confluence<a class="headerlink" href="#meijer-g-functions-of-finite-confluence" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Slater&#8217;s theorem essentially evaluates a <span class="math">\(G\)</span>-function as a sum of residues.
If all poles are simple, the resulting series can be recognised as
hypergeometric series. Thus a <span class="math">\(G\)</span>-function can be evaluated as a sum of
Hypergeometric functions.</p>
<p>If the poles are not simple, the resulting series are not hypergeometric. This
is known as the &#8220;confluent&#8221; or &#8220;logarithmic&#8221; case (the latter because the
resulting series tend to contain logarithms). The answer depends in a
complicated way on the multiplicities of various poles, and there is no
accepted notation for representing it (as far as I know).
However if there are only finitely many
multiple poles, we can evaluate the <span class="math">\(G\)</span> function as a sum of hypergeometric
functions, plus finitely many extra terms. I could not find any good reference
for this, which is why I work it out here.</p>
<p>Recall the general setup. We define</p>
<div class="math">
\[G(z) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_L \frac{\prod_{j=1}^m \Gamma(b_j - s)
  \prod_{j=1}^n \Gamma(1 - a_j + s)}{\prod_{j=m+1}^q \Gamma(1 - b_j + s)
  \prod_{j=n+1}^p \Gamma(a_j - s)} z^s \mathrm{d}s,\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(L\)</span> is a contour starting and ending at <span class="math">\(+\infty\)</span>, enclosing all of the
poles of <span class="math">\(\Gamma(b_j - s)\)</span> for <span class="math">\(j = 1, \dots, n\)</span> once in the negative
direction, and no other poles. Also the integral is assumed absolutely
convergent.</p>
<p>In what follows, for any complex numbers <span class="math">\(a, b\)</span>, we write <span class="math">\(a \equiv b \pmod{1}\)</span> if
and only if there exists an integer <span class="math">\(k\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(a - b = k\)</span>. Thus there are
double poles iff <span class="math">\(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{1}\)</span> for some <span class="math">\(i \ne j \le n\)</span>.</p>
<p>We now assume that whenever <span class="math">\(b_j \equiv a_i \pmod{1}\)</span> for <span class="math">\(i \le m\)</span>, <span class="math">\(j &gt; n\)</span>
then <span class="math">\(b_j &lt; a_i\)</span>. This means that no quotient of the relevant gamma functions
is a polynomial, and can always be achieved by &#8220;reduction of order&#8221;. Fix a
complex number <span class="math">\(c\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(\{b_i | b_i \equiv c \pmod{1}, i \le  m\}\)</span> is
not empty. Enumerate this set as <span class="math">\(b, b+k_1, \dots, b+k_u\)</span>, with <span class="math">\(k_i\)</span>
non-negative integers. Enumerate similarly
<span class="math">\(\{a_j | a_j \equiv c \pmod{1}, j &gt; n\}\)</span> as <span class="math">\(b + l_1, \dots, b + l_v\)</span>.
Then <span class="math">\(l_i &gt; k_j\)</span> for all <span class="math">\(i, j\)</span>. For finite confluence, we need to assume
<span class="math">\(v \ge u\)</span> for all such <span class="math">\(c\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(c_1, \dots, c_w\)</span> be distinct <span class="math">\(\pmod{1}\)</span> and exhaust the congruence classes
of the <span class="math">\(b_i\)</span>. I claim</p>
<div class="math">
\[G(z) = -\sum_{j=1}^w (F_j(z) + R_j(z)),\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(F_j(z)\)</span> is a hypergeometric function and <span class="math">\(R_j(z)\)</span> is a finite sum, both
to be specified later. Indeed corresponding to every <span class="math">\(c_j\)</span> there is
a sequence of poles, at mostly finitely many of them multiple poles. This is where
the <span class="math">\(j\)</span>-th term comes from.</p>
<p>Hence fix again <span class="math">\(c\)</span>, enumerate the relevant <span class="math">\(b_i\)</span> as
<span class="math">\(b, b + k_1, \dots, b + k_u\)</span>. We will look at the <span class="math">\(a_j\)</span> corresponding to
<span class="math">\(a + l_1, \dots, a + l_u\)</span>. The other <span class="math">\(a_i\)</span> are not treated specially. The
corresponding gamma functions have poles at (potentially) <span class="math">\(s = b + r\)</span> for
<span class="math">\(r = 0, 1, \dots\)</span>. For <span class="math">\(r \ge l_u\)</span>, pole of the integrand is simple. We thus set</p>
<div class="math">
\[R(z) = \sum_{r=0}^{l_u - 1} res_{s = r + b}.\]</div>
<p>We finally need to investigate the other poles. Set <span class="math">\(r = l_u + t\)</span>, <span class="math">\(t \ge 0\)</span>.
A computation shows</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{\Gamma(k_i - l_u - t)}{\Gamma(l_i - l_u - t)}
     = \frac{1}{(k_i - l_u - t)_{l_i - k_i}}
     = \frac{(-1)^{\delta_i}}{(l_u - l_i + 1)_{\delta_i}}
       \frac{(l_u - l_i + 1)_t}{(l_u - k_i + 1)_t},\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(\delta_i = l_i - k_i\)</span>.</p>
<p>Also</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}\Gamma(b_j - l_u - b - t) =
    \frac{\Gamma(b_j - l_u - b)}{(-1)^t(l_u + b + 1 - b_j)_t}, \\\end{split}\]\[\Gamma(1 - a_j + l_u + b + t) =
    \Gamma(1 - a_j + l_u + b) (1 - a_j + l_u + b)_t\]</div>
<p>and</p>
<div class="math">
\[res_{s = b + l_u + t} \Gamma(b - s) = -\frac{(-1)^{l_u + t}}{(l_u + t)!}
          = -\frac{(-1)^{l_u}}{l_u!} \frac{(-1)^t}{(l_u+1)_t}.\]</div>
<p>Hence</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}res_{s = b + l_u + t} =&amp; -z^{b + l_u}
   \frac{(-1)^{l_u}}{l_u!}
   \prod_{i=1}^{u} \frac{(-1)^{\delta_i}}{(l_u - k_i + 1)_{\delta_i}}
   \frac{\prod_{j=1}^n \Gamma(1 - a_j + l_u + b)
         \prod_{j=1}^m \Gamma(b_j - l_u - b)^*}
        {\prod_{j=n+1}^p \Gamma(a_j - l_u - b)^* \prod_{j=m+1}^q
         \Gamma(1 - b_j + l_u + b)}
   \\ &amp;\times
   z^t
   \frac{(-1)^t}{(l_u+1)_t}
   \prod_{i=1}^{u} \frac{(l_u - l_i + 1)_t}{(l_u - k_i + 1)_t}
   \frac{\prod_{j=1}^n (1 - a_j + l_u + b)_t
         \prod_{j=n+1}^p (-1)^t (l_u + b + 1 - a_j)_t^*}
        {\prod_{j=1}^m (-1)^t (l_u + b + 1 - b_j)_t^*
         \prod_{j=m+1}^q (1 - b_j + l_u + b)_t},\end{split}\]</div>
<p>where the <span class="math">\(*\)</span> means to omit the terms we treated specially.</p>
<p>We thus arrive at</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}F(z) = C \times {}_{p+1}F_{q}\left.\left(
    \begin{matrix} 1, (1 + l_u - l_i), (1 + l_u + b - a_i)^* \\
                   1 + l_u, (1 + l_u - k_i), (1 + l_u + b - b_i)^*
    \end{matrix} \right| (-1)^{p-m-n} z\right),\end{split}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(C\)</span> designates the factor in the residue independent of <span class="math">\(t\)</span>.
(This result can also be written in slightly simpler form by converting
all the <span class="math">\(l_u\)</span> etc back to <span class="math">\(a_* - b_*\)</span>, but doing so is going to require more
notation still and is not helpful for computation.)</p>

<h2>Extending The Hypergeometric Tables<a class="headerlink" href="#extending-the-hypergeometric-tables" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Adding new formulae to the tables is straightforward. At the top of the file
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sympy/simplify/hyperexpand.py</span></tt>, there is a function called
<tt class="xref py py-func docutils literal"><span class="pre">add_formulae()</span></tt>. Nested in it are defined two helpers,
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">add(ap,</span> <span class="pre">bq,</span> <span class="pre">res)</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">addb(ap,</span> <span class="pre">bq,</span> <span class="pre">B,</span> <span class="pre">C,</span> <span class="pre">M)</span></tt>, as well as dummys
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">a</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">b</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">c</span></tt>, and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">z</span></tt>.</p>
<p>The first step in adding a new formula is by using <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">add(ap,</span> <span class="pre">bq,</span> <span class="pre">res)</span></tt>. This
declares <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hyper(ap,</span> <span class="pre">bq,</span> <span class="pre">z)</span> <span class="pre">==</span> <span class="pre">res</span></tt>. Here <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ap</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">bq</span></tt> may use the
dummys <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">a</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">b</span></tt>, and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">c</span></tt> as free symbols. For example the well-known formula
<span class="math">\(\sum_0^\infty \frac{(-a)_n z^n}{n!} = (1-z)^a\)</span> is declared by the following
line: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">add((-a,</span> <span class="pre">),</span> <span class="pre">(),</span> <span class="pre">(1-z)**a)</span></tt>.</p>
<p>From the information provided, the matrices <span class="math">\(B\)</span>, <span class="math">\(C\)</span> and <span class="math">\(M\)</span> will be computed,
and the formula is now available when expanding hypergeometric functions.
Next the test file <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sympy/simplify/tests/test_hyperexpand.py</span></tt> should be run,
in particular the test <tt class="xref py py-func docutils literal"><span class="pre">test_formulae()</span></tt>. This will test the newly added
formula numerically. If it fails, there is (presumably) a typo in what was
entered.</p>
<p>Since all newly-added formulae are probably relatively complicated, chances
are that the automatically computed basis is rather suboptimal (there is no
good way of testing this, other than observing very messy output). In this
case the matrices <span class="math">\(B\)</span>, <span class="math">\(C\)</span> and <span class="math">\(M\)</span> should be computed by hand. Then the helper
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">addb</span></tt> can be used to declare a hypergeometric formula with hand-computed
basis.</p>
