<p>This page outlines SymPy’s policy on doing deprecations, and describes the
steps developers should take to properly deprecate code.</p>
<p>A list of all currently active deprecations in SymPy can be found at
<a class="reference internal" href="../../explanation/active-deprecations.html#active-deprecations"><span class="std std-ref">List of active deprecations</span></a>.</p>
<section id="what-is-a-deprecation">
<h2>What is a deprecation?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-a-deprecation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A deprecation is a way to make backwards incompatible changes in a way that
allows users to update their code. Deprecated code continues to work as it
used to, but whenever someone uses it, it prints a warning to the screen
indicating that it will be removed in a future version of SymPy, and
indicating what the user should be using instead.</p>
<p>This allows users a chance to update their code without it completely
breaking. It also gives SymPy an opportunity to give users an informative
message on how to update their code, rather than making their code simply
error or start giving wrong answers.</p>
</section>
<section id="try-to-avoid-backwards-incompatible-changes-in-the-first-place">
<h2>Try to avoid backwards incompatible changes in the first place<a class="headerlink" href="#try-to-avoid-backwards-incompatible-changes-in-the-first-place" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Backwards incompatible API changes should not be made lightly. Any backwards
compatibility break means that users will need to fix their code. Whenever you
want to make a breaking change, you should consider whether this is worth the
pain for users. Users who have to update their code to match new APIs with
every SymPy release will become frustrated with the library, and may go seek a
more stable alternative. Consider whether the behavior you want can be done in
a way that is compatible with existing APIs. New APIs do not necessarily need
to completely supplant old ones. It is sometimes possible for old APIs to
exist alongside newer, better designed ones without removing them. For
example, the newer <a class="reference internal" href="../../modules/solvers/solveset.html#solveset"><span class="std std-ref">solveset</span></a> API was designed to be a
superior replacement for the older <a class="reference internal" href="../../modules/solvers/solvers.html#solvers"><span class="std std-ref">solve</span></a> API. But the older
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">solve()</span></code> function remains intact and is still supported.</p>
<p>It is important to try to be cognizant of API design whenever adding new
functionality. Try to consider what a function may do in the future, and
design the API in a way that it can do so without having to make a breaking
change. For example, if you add a property to an object <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">A.attr</span></code>, it is
impossible to later convert that property into a method <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">A.attr()</span></code> so that it
can take arguments, except by doing so in a backwards incompatible way. If you
are unsure about your API design for a new functionality, one option is to
mark the new functionality as explicitly private or as experimental.</p>
<p>With that being said, it may be decided that the API of SymPy must change in
some incompatible way. Some reasons APIs are changed can include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The existing API is confusing.</p></li>
<li><p>There is unnecessary redundancy in the API.</p></li>
<li><p>The existing API limits what is possible.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Because one of the core use-cases of SymPy is to be usable as a library, we
take API breakage very seriously. Whenever an API breakage is necessary, the
following steps should be taken:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Discuss the API change with the community. Be sure that the improved API is
indeed better, and worth a breakage. It is important to get API right so
that we will not need to break the API again to “fix” it a second time.</p></li>
<li><p>If it is possible, deprecate the old API. The technical steps for doing this
are described <a class="reference internal" href="#deprecation-how-to"><span class="std std-ref">below</span></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Document the change so that users know how to update their code. The
documentation that should added is described
<a class="reference internal" href="#deprecation-documentation"><span class="std std-ref">below</span></a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="when-does-a-change-require-deprecation">
<h2>When does a change require deprecation?<a class="headerlink" href="#when-does-a-change-require-deprecation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When considering whether a change requires a deprecation, two things must be
considered:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is the change backwards incompatible?</p></li>
<li><p>Is the behavior changing public API?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A change is backwards incompatible if user code making use of it would stop
working after the change.</p>
<p>What counts as “public API” needs to be considered on a case-by-case basis.
The exact rules for what does and doesn’t constitute public API for SymPy are
still not yet fully codified. Cleaning up the distinction between public and
private APIs, as well as the categorization in the reference documentation is
currently an <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/23037">open issue for
SymPy</a>.</p>
<p>Here are some thing that constitute public API. <em>Note: these are just general
guidelines. This list is not exhaustive, and there are always exceptions to
the rules.</em></p>
<div class="admonition-public-api admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Public API</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Function names.</p></li>
<li><p>Keyword argument names.</p></li>
<li><p>Keyword argument default values.</p></li>
<li><p>Positional argument order.</p></li>
<li><p>Submodule names.</p></li>
<li><p>The mathematical conventions used to define a function.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>And here are some things that generally aren’t public API, and therefore don’t
require deprecations to change (again, this list is only a general set of
guidelines).</p>
<div class="admonition-not-public-api admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Not Public API</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The precise form of an expression. In general, functions may be changed to
return a different but mathematically equivalent form of the same
expression. This includes a function returning a value which it was not able
to compute previously.</p></li>
<li><p>Functions and methods that are private, i.e., for internal use only. Such
things should generally be prefixed with an underscore <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">_</span></code>, although this
convention is not currently universally adhered to in the SymPy codebase.</p></li>
<li><p>Anything explicitly marked as “experimental”.</p></li>
<li><p>Changes to behavior that were mathematically incorrect previously (in
general, bug fixes are not considered breaking changes, because despite the
saying, bugs in SymPy are not features).</p></li>
<li><p>Anything that was added before the most recent release. Code that has not
yet made it into a release does not need to be deprecated. If you are going
to change the API of new code, it is best to do it before a release is made
so that no deprecations are necessary for future releases.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Note: both public and private API functions are included in the <a class="reference internal" href="../../reference/index.html#reference"><span class="std std-ref">reference
documentation</span></a>, and many functions are not included there which
should be, or are not documented at all which should be, so this should not be
used to determine whether something public or not.</p>
<p>If you’re unsure, there is no harm in deprecating something even if it might
not actually be “public API”.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-purpose-of-deprecation">
<h2>The purpose of deprecation<a class="headerlink" href="#the-purpose-of-deprecation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Deprecation has several purposes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>To allow existing code to continue to work for a while, giving people a
chance to upgrade SymPy without fixing all deprecation issues immediately.</p></li>
<li><p>To warn users that their code will break in a future version.</p></li>
<li><p>To inform users how to fix their code so that it will continue work in
future versions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All deprecation warnings should be something that users can remove by updating
their code. Deprecation warnings that fire unconditionally, even when using
the “correct” newer APIs, should be avoided.</p>
<p>This also means all deprecated code must have a completely functioning
replacement. If there is no way for users to update their code, then this
means API in question is not yet read to be deprecated. The deprecation
warning should inform users of a way to change their code so that it works in
the same version of SymPy, as well as all future versions, and, if possible,
previous versions of SymPy as well. See <a class="reference internal" href="#deprecation-documentation"><span class="std std-ref">below</span></a>.</p>
<p>Deprecations should always</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Allow users to continue to use the existing APIs unchanged during the
deprecation period (with a warning, which can be
<a class="reference internal" href="../../explanation/active-deprecations.html#silencing-sympy-deprecation-warnings"><span class="std std-ref">silenced</span></a> with
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">warnings.filterwarnings</span></code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Allow users to always fix their code so that it stops giving the warning.</p></li>
<li><p>After users fix their code, it should continue to work after the deprecated
code is removed.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The third point is important. We do not want the “new” method to itself cause
another API break when the deprecation period is over. Doing this would
completely defeat the purpose of doing a deprecation.</p>
<section id="when-it-is-not-technically-possible-to-deprecate">
<h3>When it is not technically possible to deprecate<a class="headerlink" href="#when-it-is-not-technically-possible-to-deprecate" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In some cases, this is not technically possible to make a deprecation that
follows the above three rules. API changes of this nature should be considered
the most heavily, as they will break people’s code immediately without
warning. Consideration into how easy it will be for users to support multiple
versions of SymPy, one with the change and one without, should also be taken
into account.</p>
<p>If you decide that the change is nonetheless worth making, there are two
options:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Make the non-deprecatable change immediately, with no warnings. This will
break user code.</p></li>
<li><p>Warn that the code will change in the future. There won’t be a way for users
to fix their code until a version is released with the breaking change, but
they will at least be aware that changes are coming.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Which of the two to make should decided on a case-by-case basis.</p>

</section>
<section id="how-long-should-deprecations-last">
<h2>How long should deprecations last?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-long-should-deprecations-last" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Deprecations should remain intact for <strong>at least 1 year</strong> after the first
major release is made with the deprecation. This is only a minimum period:
deprecations are allowed to remain intact for longer than this. If a change is
especially hard for users to migrate, the deprecation period should be
lengthened. The period may also be lengthened for deprecated features that do
not impose a significant maintenance burden to keep around.</p>
<p>The deprecation period policy is time-based rather than release-based for a
few reasons. Firstly, SymPy does not have a regular release schedule.
Sometimes multiple releases will be made in a year, and some years only a
single release will be made. Being time-based assures that users have
sufficient opportunity to update their code regardless of how often releases
happen to be made.</p>
<p>Secondly, SymPy does not make use of a rigorous versioning scheme like
semantic versioning. The API surface of SymPy and number of contributions are
both large enough that virtually every major release has some deprecations and
backwards incompatible changes made in some submodule. Encoding this into the
version number would be virtually impossible. The development team also does
not backport changes to prior major releases, except in extreme cases. Thus a
time-based deprecation scheme is more accurate to SymPy’s releasing model than
a version-based one would be.</p>
<p>Finally, a time-based scheme removes any temptation to “fudge” a deprecation
period down by releasing early. The best way for the developers to accelerate
the removal of deprecated functionality is to make a release containing the
deprecation as early as possible.</p>

The
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">deprecated_since_version</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">active_deprecations_target</span></code> flags are
required. Do not use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SymPyDeprecationWarning</span></code> class directly to issue a
deprecation warning. Please see the docstring of
<a class="reference internal" href="../../modules/utilities/exceptions.html#sympy.utilities.exceptions.sympy_deprecation_warning" title="sympy.utilities.exceptions.sympy_deprecation_warning"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sympy_deprecation_warning()</span></code></a> for more information. See
<a class="reference internal" href="#deprecation-documentation"><span class="std std-ref">below</span></a> for an example.</p>
<p>Add a test for the deprecated behavior. Use the

<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">warns_deprecated_sympy</span></code> is only intended to be used internally by the SymPy
test suite. Users of SymPy should use the
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html">warnings</a> module directly to
filter SymPy deprecation warnings. See <a class="reference internal" href="../../explanation/active-deprecations.html#silencing-sympy-deprecation-warnings"><span class="std std-ref">Silencing SymPy Deprecation Warnings</span></a>.</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This should be the only part of the codebase and test suite that uses the
deprecated behavior. Everything else should be changed to use the new,
non-deprecated behavior. The SymPy test suite is configured to fail if a
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SymPyDeprecationWarning</span></code> is issued anywhere except in a
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">warns_deprecated_sympy()</span></code> block. You should not use this function or a
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">warnings.filterwarnings(SymPyDeprecationWarning)</span></code> anywhere except in the test
for the deprecation. This includes the documentation examples. The
documentation for a deprecated function should just have a note pointing to
the non-deprecated alternative. If you want to show a deprecated function in a
doctest use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">#</span> <span class="pre">doctest:</span> <span class="pre">+SKIP</span></code>. The only exception to this rule is that you
may use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ignore_warnings(SymPyDeprecationWarning)</span></code> to prevent the exact same
warning from triggering twice, i.e., if a deprecated function calls another
function that issues the same or a similar warning.</p>
<p>If it is not possible to remove the deprecated behavior somewhere, that is a
sign that it is not ready to be deprecated yet. Consider that users may not be
able to replace the deprecated behavior for exact same reason.</p>

discuss why a feature was deprecated or unnecessary internal technical
details. This discussion can go in the other sections mentioned below. Do
not include information in the message that is already part of the metadata
provided to the keyword arguments to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sympy_deprecation_warning()</span></code>, like the
version number or a link to the active deprecations document. Remember that
the warning text will be shown in plain-text, so do not use RST or Markdown
markup in the text. Code blocks should be clearly delineated with newlines
so that they are easy to read. All text in the warning message should be
wrapped to 80 characters, except for code examples that cannot be wrapped.</p>
<p>Always include full context of what is deprecated in the message. For
example, write “the abc keyword to func() is deprecated” instead of just
“the abc keyword is deprecated”. That way if a user has a larger line of
code that is using the deprecated functionality, it will be easier for them
to see exactly which part is causing the warning.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A deprecation note in the relevant docstring(s). This should use the
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html#directive-deprecated"><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">deprecated</span></code></a>
Sphinx directive. This uses the syntax <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">..</span> <span class="pre">deprecated::</span> <span class="pre">&lt;version&gt;</span></code>. If the
entire function is deprecated, this should be placed at the top of the
docstring, right below the first line. Otherwise, if only part of a function
is deprecated (e.g., a single keyword argument), it should be placed near
the part of the docstring that discusses that feature, e.g., in the
parameters list.</p>
<p>The text in the deprecation should be short (no more than a paragraph),
explaining what is deprecated and what users should use instead. If you
want, you may use the same text here as in the
<a class="reference internal" href="../../modules/utilities/exceptions.html#sympy.utilities.exceptions.sympy_deprecation_warning" title="sympy.utilities.exceptions.sympy_deprecation_warning"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sympy_deprecation_warning()</span></code></a>. Be sure to use RST formatting,
including cross-references to the new function if relevant, and a
cross-reference to the longer description in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">active-deprecations.md</span></code>
document (see <a class="reference internal" href="#deprecations-longer-description"><span class="std std-ref">below</span></a>).</p>
<p>If the documentation for the feature is otherwise the same as the replaced
feature (i.e., the deprecation is just a renaming of a function or
argument), you may replace the rest of the documentation with a note like
“see the documentation for &lt;new feature&gt;”. Otherwise, the documentation
for the deprecated functionality should be left intact.</p>

<ul id="deprecations-longer-description">
<li><p>A longer description of the deprecation should be added to <a class="reference internal" href="../../explanation/active-deprecations.html#active-deprecations"><span class="std std-ref">the page listing
all currently active deprecations</span></a> in the
documentation (in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">doc/src/explanation/active-deprecations.md</span></code>).</p>
<p>This page is where you can go into more detail about the technical details
of a deprecation. Here you should also list <em>why</em> a feature was deprecated.
You may link to relevant issues, pull requests, and mailing list discussions
about the deprecation, but these discussion should be summarized so that
users can get the basic idea of why the deprecation without having to read
through pages of old discussions. You may also give longer examples here
that would not fit in the <a class="reference internal" href="../../modules/utilities/exceptions.html#sympy.utilities.exceptions.sympy_deprecation_warning" title="sympy.utilities.exceptions.sympy_deprecation_warning"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sympy_deprecation_warning()</span></code></a> message or
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">..</span> <span class="pre">deprecated::</span></code> text.</p>
<p>Every deprecation should have a cross-reference target (using
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">(target-name)=</span></code> above the section header) so that the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">..</span> <span class="pre">deprecated::</span></code>
note in the relevant docstring can refer to it. This target should also be
passed to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">active_deprecations_target</span></code> option of
<a class="reference internal" href="../../modules/utilities/exceptions.html#sympy.utilities.exceptions.sympy_deprecation_warning" title="sympy.utilities.exceptions.sympy_deprecation_warning"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sympy_deprecation_warning()</span></code></a> or <a class="reference internal" href="../../modules/utilities/decorator.html#sympy.utilities.decorator.deprecated" title="sympy.utilities.decorator.deprecated"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&#64;deprecated</span></code></a>. This will automatically put a link
to the page in the documentation in the warning message. The target name
should include the word “deprecation” or “deprecated” (target names are
global in Sphinx, so the target name needs to be unique across the entire
documentation).</p>
<p>The section header name should be the thing that is deprecated, and should
be a level 3 header under the corresponding version (typically it should be
added to the top of the file).</p>
<p>If multiple deprecations are related to one another, they can all share a
single section on this page.</p>
<p>If the deprecated function is not included in the top-level
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sympy/__init__.py</span></code> be sure to clearly indicate which submodule the object
is referring to. If you refer to anything that is documented in the Sphinx
module reference, cross-reference it, like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">{func}`~.func_name`</span></code>.</p>
<p>Note that examples here are helpful, but you generally should not use
doctests to show the deprecated functionality, as this will itself raise the
deprecation warning and fail the doctest. Instead you may use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">#</span> <span class="pre">doctest:</span> <span class="pre">+SKIP</span></code>, or just show the example as a code block instead of a doctest.</p>
<p>Here are examples corresponding to the (imaginary) examples above:</p>
<div class="highlight-md notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>(simplify-this-deprecation)=
<span class="gu">### `simplify_this()`</span>

The <span class="sb">`sympy.simplify.simplify_this()`</span> function is deprecated. It has been
replaced with the {func}`~.simplify` function. Code using <span class="sb">`simplify_this()`</span>
can be fixed by replacing <span class="sb">`simplfiy_this(expr)`</span> with <span class="sb">`simplify(expr)`</span>. The
behavior of the two functions is otherwise identical.

This change was made because <span class="sb">`simplify`</span> is a much more Pythonic name than
<span class="sb">`simplify_this`</span>.
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-md notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>(is-this-zero-y-deprecation)=
<span class="gu">### `is_this_zero()` second argument</span>
The second argument to {func}`~.is_this_zero()` is deprecated. Previously
<span class="sb">`is_this_zero(x, y)`</span> would check if x = y. However, this was removed because
it is trivially equivalent to <span class="sb">`is_this_zero(x - y)`</span>. Furthermore, allowing
to check $x=y$ in addition to just $x=0$ is is confusing given the function
is named &quot;is this zero&quot;.

In particular, replace

<span class="sb">```py</span>
<span class="n">is_this_zero</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">expr1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">expr2</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="sb">```</span>

with

<span class="sb">```py</span>
<span class="n">is_this_zero</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">expr1</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">expr2</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="sb">```</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the above examples, there are dozens of examples of existing
deprecations which can be found by searching for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sympy_deprecation_warning</span></code>
in the SymPy codebase</p>
</section>
<section id="release-notes-entry">
<h3>Release notes entry<a class="headerlink" href="#release-notes-entry" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In the pull request, document the breaking change in the release notes section
with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BREAKING</span> <span class="pre">CHANGE</span></code>.</p>
<p>Once the PR is merged, you should also add it to the “Backwards compatibility
breaks and deprecations” section of the release notes for the upcoming
release. This needs to be done manually, in addition to the change from the
bot. See
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/Writing-Release-Notes#backwards-compatibility-breaks-and-deprecations">https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/Writing-Release-Notes#backwards-compatibility-breaks-and-deprecations</a></p>
<p>Whenever a deprecated functionality is removed entirely after its deprecation
period, this also needs to be marked as a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BREAKING</span> <span class="pre">CHANGE</span></code> and added to the
“Backwards compatibility breaks and deprecations” section of the release
notes.</p>
